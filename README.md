# Alien-invasion

This is a little fun game that I have made a little while ago when I was first starting to learn Game Development with Pygame.

It is a fun game to play. You can fork the repo and run the following command to start playing:

python3 alien_invasion.py (assuming you cd into the directory and have installed python3 and the pygame library)

I might pick up the game again.

Inspired from the following book (which I highly recommend for beginners):

Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming
